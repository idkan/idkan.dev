As someone who is highly focused on improving/learning personal and working skill daily. I'm thrilled at the opportunity to show off my potential as a software engineer.

<br />
I enjoy being challenged and engaging with project that require me to work outside my comfort and knowledge set, as continuing to learn new technologies/programming languages and development techniques are important to my self.

<br />
I consider myself like code enthusiast, responsible, proactive, creative, motivated, easy adaptation to teamwork and organization. I will sometimes obsess over ways to automate the most superficial tasks and to improve those processes that I will take almost the time it would've taken me to do the task itself, with the advantage that next time I would finish in a fraction of the time so I believe that this quality is essential to continue creating the best solutions on the market.
