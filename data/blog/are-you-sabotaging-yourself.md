## Are you sabotaging your own success‚ùì‚ùì‚ùì
There's an enemy that haunts us all. It's a silent, invisible enemy that can hold us back from achieving our goals. It's a self-sabotaging enemy that can make us feel like we're not good enough, that we don't deserve success, and that we're not worthy of the things we want. The enemy is, of course - ourselves.
That's right, we're our own worst enemy. Without even realizing it, we could be sabotaging our entire career. 
In this article, we'll look at some of the most common self-sabotaging behaviors and how to overcome them.

## Hiding your mistakes
We all make mistakes. It's a part of life. But when you're in a team, it's important to be open about your mistakes.
Admitting when you're wrong is a blow to your ego, but it's also a sign of strength. It shows that you're willing to learn from your mistakes and that you're not afraid to admit when you're wrong.
If you do make a mistake that is public or somehow got into production (which is a mistake in itself), don't hide it, it's the worst thing you could do. Instead, take responsibility and learn from it.

Everyone make mistakes; it's only human! But how you handle them is what matters. If people know that you're the type of person who will own up to their mistakes, they'll be more likely to trust you and repsect your transparency.
On the other hand, if you're the type of person who hides their mistakes, people will be less likely to trust you and will be less likely to come to you for help.
So even if you're afraid of what people will think of you, don't be afraid to admit when you're wrong. It's a sign of strength and it will help you build trust with your team.

## Not asking for help
Asking for help is a sign of strength. It shows that you're willing to learn from others and that you're not afraid to admit when you don't know something.
Getting stuck on a problem is a normal part of the development process. If you're lucky enough to have coworkers or a boss that you can ask for help, the question is, WHEN should you ask for help?
The answer is, as soon as you need it. You dont't want to ask right away before trying to figure out the solution yourself because that can become annoying for your coworkers. And part of being a developer is learning the arcane art of googling. But if you've tried everything and you're still stuck, don't be afraid to ask for help.Don't wait until you're stuck for hours or even days. The sooner you ask for help, the sooner you'll get unstuck and the sooner you'll be able to move on to the next task.

## Closing yourself off'
This is one of the most damaging ways that you can hurt your career. If you're the type of person who closes themselves off from others or be overly defensive, you're going to have a hard time building relationships with your coworkers and even worst losing your job.

I realized over time is that ultimately your inexperience isn't as big a problem as you might imagine it is. Everyone just wants to get the work done as quickly and efficiently as possible. And if you're the type of person who's willing to learn and who's willing to ask for help, people will be more than happy to help you out.
No one actually care if you don't know everything off the top of your head. And it was fine you need a little time to research and test things out. It's important to learn that it's okay to say "I don't know how to do this, but I can try to figure it out, and update you in a couple of hours".
The worst thing you can do in a work project is to block progress of the work and not help find a solution. 


All right! So we've covered some of the most common self-sabotaging behaviors. But how do you overcome them? Well, the first step is to recognize that you're doing it. Once you recognize that you're doing it, you can start to take steps to overcome it.
Obiously overcoming insecurities and self-doubt is not an easy task, and if you struggle with it, like I do, it's going to be something that you might spend your entire career working on. But the good news is that it's possible to overcome these self-sabotaging behaviors. And the more you work on it, the easier it will get, just remember that you're not alone. We all struggle with it, and we're all in this together and over time you'll get a lot better at it.

So, don't kick yourself for every little thing that you don't know. Every piece of knowledge that you don't know today is something that you can learn tomorrow. And ultimately, the more skills you acquire, the more confident you will become over time.

I hope this post can help you in the fight against your own self-sabotaging behaviors. If you have any questions, comments, or I've missed anything, feel free to let me know down in the comments. And if you enjoyed this post, please share it with your friends and coworkers.
